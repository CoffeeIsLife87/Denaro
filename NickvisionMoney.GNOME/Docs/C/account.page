<title>Account</title>
<p>This page explains all properties of accounts in <app>Denaro</app>. Most of them are shown in <gui>Account Settings Dialog</gui>, which can be opened from Account Actions. This dialog also opens automatically after you create a new account.</p>

<terms>
	<item>
		<title>Name</title>
		<p>Account name is shown in the list of recent accounts and in tabs. A name doesn't have a length limit and it can contain any characters, including emojis.</p>
	</item>
	<item>
		<title>Account Type</title>
		<p>There are 3 account types available: Checking, Savings and Business. Account type is only a useful label that is shown in the list of recent accounts and doesn't affect how the application works or what you can do with an account. Each account type has its own color, these colors can be configured in <link xref="settings">settings</link>.</p>
	</item>
	<item>
		<title>Default Transaction Type</title>
		<p>When you create a new <link xref="transaction">transaction</link> its type by default will be the same as in this setting.</p>
	</item>
	<item>
		<title>System Currency</title>
		<p>Every time the application starts, it gets data about currency and numbers formatting from your system locale, and this data is used to show currency symbol (unless custom currency is used, see below) and to determine in what format the numbers will be accepted as values for transaction amounts. A few examples:</p>
		<list>
			<item><p>If your locale is <em>English (US)</em>, currency symbol will be set to <em>$</em> and <em>1,000.00</em> will be accepted as a valid number.</p></item>
			<item><p>If your locale is <em>Italian</em>, currency symbol will be set to <em>€</em> and <em>1.000,00</em> will be accepted as a valid number.</p></item>
			<item><p>If your locale is <em>Russian</em>, currency symbol will be set to <em>₽</em> and <em>1000,00</em> will be accepted as a valid number.</p></item>
		</list>
		<note style="warning">
			<p>On Linux it's possible to set different locales for system language and formats. <app>Denaro</app> will try to use formats locale, and in case of failure it will fallback to language locale. This behaviour is not considired a bug. In case of such failure, please use custom currency (see below).</p>
		</note>
	</item>
	<item>
		<title>Use Custom Currency</title>
		<p>If this option is enabled, <gui>Custom Currency Symbol</gui> will be used instead of currency symbol provided by your system locale.</p>
	</item>
	<item>
		<title>Custom Currency Symbol</title>
		<p>Only one character can be used as currency symbol, but it can be any character, including emoji.</p>
	</item>
	<item>
		<title>Custom Currency Code</title>
		<p>Optional code for your custom currency. If it's set, it will be shown in dialogs in parentheses next to <gui>Custom Currency Symbol</gui>. <gui>Custom Currency Code</gui> can contain up to 3 characters.</p>
	</item>
	<item>
		<title>Sorting Order</title>

	</item>
	<item>
		<title>Groups Visibility</title>
		<p>Each account stores information about whether the <link xref="group">groups</link> list in the main window is hidden or not. Every time you change groups list visibility, it's saved and then restored when you reopen the account.</p>
