<title>Transfer</title>
<p>Transfer is a way to move money from one account to another. After running a transfer 2 transactions will be created with the following descriptions:</p>
<list>
	<item>
		<p>Â«Transfer to <input>Destination Account Name</input>Â» on source account.</p>
	</item>
	<item>
		<p>Â«Transfer from <input>Source Account Name</input>Â» on destination account.</p>
	</item>
</list>
<p>Transactions created using transfer are simple transactions that can be freely edited or deleted. These transactions are not connected: modifying transaction on source account will not affect transaction on destination account, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Transfer doesn't allow you to create repeating transactions or set any properties other than the amount. The color selected in <link xref="configuration">configuration</link> will be used for created transactions.</p>
<p>Although <app>Denaro</app> supports accounts with different currencies, transfer amounts are not automatically converted for their respective currencies. The number value will be used as is. For example: if you transfer 100$ (USD) to an account that uses â‚¬ (EUR) the following two transactions will be created:</p>
<list>
	<item>
		<p>On source account: expense transaction for 100$ (USD).</p>
	</item>
	<item>
		<p>On destination account: income transaction for 100â‚¬ (EUR).</p>
	</item>
</list>
<note>
	<p>We are looking to implement a feature to set a conversion rate for different currencies during transfer in a future version, see <link href="https://github.com/nlogozzo/NickvisionMoney/issues/144">issue #144</link>.</p>
